                        <p class="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 dark:text-gray-400">The React Context API is <strong>a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around</strong>. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using Redux.</p>

                        <p class="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 dark:text-gray-400">The hook useRef() in React returns an object that has a property current that we can access as we do with objects. This property is initialized to the passed argument in the function useRef() . The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component. <br /><br />
                        1. The hook useRef() accepts one argument, which is the value to initialize the property current in the returned object.
                        <br />
                        2. In order to use the hook useRef , you will have to import it from the React package first.
